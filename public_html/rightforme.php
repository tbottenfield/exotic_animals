  <h2> Finding the Perfect Pet </h2>

  <h3>Step 1: Research </h3>
      <p class="smallerwidth"> There are several different types of exotic animals that are legal to own here in the U.S. 
       In order to decide which best suits your wants and needs, you must first do your research. 
       Do not simply purchase one of our beautiful creatures because it will "make others jealous" 
       or because it gives you something interesting to talk about in the elevator. These are awful 
       reasons to get an exotic animal. Please do your research prior to making this big of a commitment.
       Also, take note that certain types of exotic animals require a USDA permit and/or other licensing. </p>
      
  <h3> Step 2: Meeting the Animal for the First Time </h3>
      <p class="smallerwidth"> Becoming a mommy or daddy to an animal is a huge change in both the owners' and pets' lives.
       It's wise to meet the animal and see if it likes you and will fit well in your environment. 
      For example, if you live in Texas where it is hot, Flipper the penguin may not be a good choice. 
      Although he enjoys watching bull riding and wearing cowboy hats, he will not like the heat. 
      Please meet the animal and become its' friend before making a major life decision such as this. </p>
      
  <h3> Step 3: Bringing Your New Pet Home </h3>
      <p class="smallerwidth"> Once you have chosen your pet and have paid us, you get to take it home! It's important to give it 
       a house tour, otherwise it may get lost and scared. You don't want to know what a zebra does when it 
       becomes frightened. </p>
